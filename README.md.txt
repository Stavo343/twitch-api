This Twitch API tracks five specific channels and displays the status for each one. User stories given as guidelines for this project are:

1. I can see whether Free Code Camp is currently streaming on Twitch.tv.
2. I can click the status output and be sent directly to the Free Code Camp's Twitch.tv channel.
3. If a Twitch user is currently streaming, I can see additional details about what they are streaming.
4. I will see a placeholder notification if a streamer has closed their Twitch account (or the account never existed). You can verify this works by adding brunofin and comster404 to your array of Twitch streamers.
